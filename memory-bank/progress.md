# Progress

## Current status

### Project phase: Pattern Analysis Agent development in progress

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Foundation complete + Pattern Analysis Agent API detection functional**

### Pattern Analysis Agent implementation (üîÑ In Progress)

#### API endpoint detection

- **Network request parsing**: Extracts REST endpoints from captured network requests
- **Path pattern recognition**: Converts specific URLs like `/users/123` to patterns like `/users/{id}`
- **Base URL extraction**: Separates base URLs from path patterns for clean organization
- **HTTP method tracking**: Tracks GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for each endpoint

#### Duplicate consolidation

- **Smart merging**: Multiple calls to same endpoint pattern are consolidated into single entries

- **Unique key generation**: Creates unique keys for endpoint consolidation based on method + URL pattern
- **Data preservation**: Maintains original URL examples while creating generalized patterns

#### TDD implementation

- **Test-first development**: All functionality implemented using strict TDD cycles
- **Small increments**: Each feature added through focused, small test cases
- **Refactoring discipline**: Code improved after each passing test
- **Clean architecture**: Well-structured code with helper methods and separation of concerns
