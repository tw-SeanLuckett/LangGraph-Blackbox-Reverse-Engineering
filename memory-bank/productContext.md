# Product context

## Why this project exists

### Business problem

Organizations often face challenges with legacy software systems:

- **Lost source code**: Critical business applications with no available source code
- **Knowledge gaps**: Original developers no longer available, documentation missing
- **Modernization needs**: Legacy systems need to be updated or replaced
- **Integration challenges**: Understanding how legacy systems work for integration purposes
- **Compliance requirements**: Need to document system behavior for audits and regulations

### AI opportunity

LangGraph and AI agents provide a powerful approach for:

- **Automated analysis**: AI can systematically explore and document system behavior
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify complex business logic through interaction patterns
- **Code generation**: Recreate system functionality in modern technology stacks
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Generate detailed system documentation automatically

### Blackbox methodology value

Implementing blackbox reverse engineering ensures:

- **No source code dependency**: Work with systems where source code is unavailable
- **Behavioral focus**: Understand what the system does, not how it's implemented
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Systematic exploration of all system capabilities
- **Validation ready**: Generated understanding can be tested against actual system behavior
