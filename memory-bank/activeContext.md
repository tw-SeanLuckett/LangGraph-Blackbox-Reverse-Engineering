   - Complex business logic inference
   - Integration between generated components

## Active decisions and considerations

### Technical architecture decisions

#### LangGraph workflow design

```python
# Proposed agent workflow
class ReverseEngineeringWorkflow:
    agents = [
        "journey_executor",    # Browser automation
        "data_capturer",      # Log analysis
        "pattern_analyzer",   # Business logic inference
        "backend_generator",  # Python code generation
        "frontend_generator", # React code generation
        "documentation_generator" # System documentation
    ]
```

#### State management approach

- **Persistent state**: Maintain context across agent interactions
- **Conditional workflows**: Different paths based on discovered patterns
- **Iterative refinement**: Loop back for additional data gathering

### Pending technical questions

- **Audit data specifics**: What additional data beyond standard browser interactions?
- **Database correlation**: Custom logging needs for database correlation?
- **Agent coordination**: Specific LangGraph coordination strategies
- **Validation approach**: Integration with QA team's test harness

### Business alignment questions

- **Initial workflow selection**: Which business domain workflow to start with?
- **System access**: Confirmation of database access availability
- **Success criteria**: How to measure reverse engineering accuracy?
- **QA integration**: Coordination with separate QA validation team

## Current blockers and risks

### Information gaps

- **Target system access**: Need access to legacy system for testing
- **Simple test workflow**: Need to identify first workflow to experiment with
- **Database access confirmation**: Uncertainty about data access level
- **QA team coordination**: Integration points with validation framework

### Technical uncertainties

- **LangGraph complexity**: Multi-agent coordination challenges
